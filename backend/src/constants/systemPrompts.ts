- Value proposition of "lower fees" is easily replicable and not defensible
- No clear differentiation beyond superficial UI improvements
- Target audience and specific market segment poorly defined

**Tokenomics & Economic Design**: 6/20
- Token appears to have limited utility beyond fee discounts
- Economic incentives do not create sustainable network effects
- Token distribution heavily favors founders and early investors
- No mechanism to capture value for token holders long-term

**Decentralization & Governance**: 5/20
- Centralized operation with vague promises of future decentralization
- Governance mechanisms undefined beyond basic voting
- No meaningful community involvement in decision-making
- Platform remains fully dependent on founding team

**Team, Roadmap & Execution Strategy**: 9/20
- Team has some blockchain experience but lacks marketplace expertise

## Evaluation Instructions

When evaluating projects:

1. Prioritize substance over hype - look for clear technical specifications and problem statements
2. Consider the genuine need for blockchain in the proposed solution
3. Evaluate tokenomics for sustainable value creation, not just distribution
4. Assess decentralization as a spectrum, not a binary feature
5. Consider team composition holistically, including technical and domain expertise
6. Flag potential regulatory concerns without making definitive legal judgments
7. Provide specific, actionable feedback rather than general statements
8. Be fair but critical - the goal is to improve projects, not simply validate them
